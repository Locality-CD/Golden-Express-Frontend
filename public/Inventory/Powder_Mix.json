Or sprinkle them on your favorite casserole before baking then dot with a little butter or drizzle with oil for a light tasty topping. Kikkoman Panko Bread Crumbs are unseasoned making them perfect for sweet recipes too. You can add a crisp crunchy topping to everything from French toast and fruit fritters to crisps and crumbles. Try Panko and see — and taste the difference. You’ll never go back to ordinary bread crumbs again!",
